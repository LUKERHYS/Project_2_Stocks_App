# Stocks & Shares Portfolio Tracking App

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP

A user should be able to:

* View total current value.
* View individual and total performance trends.
* Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
* VView a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

## Summary

A full CRUD application built with VueJS, MongoDB, Express, HTML & CSS. The application used a custom restAPI API to serve data from a Mongo db backend to a vueJS front end assisted by HighCarts to give the flow of data a meaningful layout.
The application used the Alphavantage stocks and shares data to give a live data feed with our own api storing personalised information about your chosen stocks and shares.
